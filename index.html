                <h1>MANAGE E-WASTE PROPERLY</h1>
                <p> 
                    E-waste is the fastest-growing solid waste globally, with 53.6 million tonnes produced in 2019, but only 17.4% recycled. Hazardous substances like lead are released through improper disposal methods. E-waste recycling poses health risks, especially to children and pregnant women, with millions of informal workers, including women and children, at risk of exposure, according to ILO and WHO.

            <div>
                <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
                <p>E-waste contains harmful chemicals like lead and mercury that can contaminate soil and water. When burned, it releases toxic gases that contribute to air pollution and climate change.</p>
                
                <h2>Human Health Risks</h2>
                <p>In developing countries, e-waste is often dismantled without proper safety, exposing workers to dangerous toxins. This leads to severe health problems like respiratory issues and nerve damage.</p>
                
                <h2>A Global Problem</h2>
                <p>E-waste is often exported to poorer countries, worsening environmental and health issues in already vulnerable communities.</p>

                <h2>Rapid Technological Advancements</h2>
                <p>The fast pace of innovation in electronics leads to frequent upgrades. Consumers replace devices like smartphones and laptops regularly, contributing to the rise of e-waste as older models become obsolete.</p>

            <div class="block">
                <h2>Short Product Lifecycles</h2>
                <p>Manufacturers design products with shorter lifespans, encouraging consumers to buy newer versions frequently. This practice, known as planned obsolescence, increases the amount of discarded electronics.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h2>Lack of Proper Recycling Infrastructure</h2>
                <p>In many parts of the world, there is inadequate infrastructure for recycling electronic devices. As a result, most e-waste ends up in landfills or is improperly handled, worsening the global e-waste problem.</p>

                <p>Focus: Design electronics for longer use, repair, and recycling.<br>
                Actions: Encourage repair, refurbishment, and efficient recycling to reduce waste and recover valuable materials.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)</h2>
                <p>Focus: Hold manufacturers accountable for the full lifecycle of their products.<br>
                Actions: Mandate companies to take back old devices for recycling and adopt eco-friendly production practices.</p>

            <div>

                <p>Focus: Educate consumers on e-waste impacts and proper disposal.<br>
                Actions: Promote recycling, set up collection points, and encourage responsible consumption.</p>
